## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!


1. What is Git?
Git is an open source version control system. It allows the user to do Github related things locally on their computer.
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?
Github is a cloud that stores code and other information and git is used to track and manage code.
3. Why do we create a branch?
Branches are created so that someone can make and test changes to a project separately without directly effecting the main code.
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request?
The purpose of a pull request is to let other collaborators know what changes you've pushed into a branch of a repository. Changes of an individual's branch and the main branch of a repository can be compared at this point.
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on the FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main.
The command you would use to switch between branches is git checkout -b 'name of branch'. In this case the branch name would be 'main'.
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do?
Git fetch is used to download code to your local computer from a remote repository. Git merge is used to merge the work of others with your own. Git pull is a shortcut that does the actions of fetch and merge.
7. What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict is when competing changes are made to the same component of a file such as a line of code.
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict?
A merge comflict can be resolved by deciding which changes will be kept and then creating a new commit. Once that has been completed, a merge can be attempted again which should so no conflict.
